# Wordlebot

- A simple Console game of Wordle, built in Rust.
- This version of the game is incredibly simple, only using a few basic Rust constructs, as well as using the import of the Wordle-lib component. It prints the game board as the game is played, informs the user of errors, and implements the basic game loop, reading line-input and passing it to `game.guess()`. The game ends when the Lose or Win states are reached.
